This is a source service for Open Build Service.  It allows you to use a sed script to process a file in
your OBS file.  The _services.emacs file gives an example of how a file can be downloaded, have a version
number extracted by a sed script into a file.  Then the set_version service can pick up the result and
store it in the build recipe.

Cloning the git repo for emacs just to extract some version information is ridiculously expensive.  The
full repo is (at this time) approx 1.6GB, while the uncompressed source from the tarball is less than
200MB.  And configure.ac is all of 230K.
